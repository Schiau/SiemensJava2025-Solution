## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


## What i did
- I modify ItemController to have correct codes and logic (where it need it)
- I modify the method processItemsAsync to return only the processed item of the current call and made sure to use data type which are thread-safe and make it to throw expcetion if it need
- I made 2 test class one for ItemService (ItemServiceTest) and one for ItemController (ItemControllerTest)
- I modift the Item class to have validation (i considered all the filed to be mandatory) and the email to have a standart format
- I put comments in the controll and service where i considered
